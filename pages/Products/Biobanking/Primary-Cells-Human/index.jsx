                      Primary cells, like fibroblasts and blood cells, are the
                      foundation material of cellular studies. But often
                      commercial products lack information about derivation,
                      sourcing, and characterisation. This can impact not only
                      research output but also downstream applications. Cell
                      authentication is becoming an important requirement for
                      publishing in high impact journals and acquiring
                      regulatory approval. Our cells are unique as they have the
                      genotype information available for major drug-metabolizing
                      enzymes such as Cytochrome P450.

                        Yes, there are several methods for immortalizing
                        mammalian cells in culture conditions. Overriding the
                        cell cycle with a viral gene is one of the most common
                        methods. Virus genes can affect cell proliferation by
                        deregulating biological brakes controlling proliferative
                        control. The expression of Telomerase Reverse
                        Transcriptase protein (TERT) is another method,
                        particularly for human cells, which are highly affected
                        by shortened telomeres. The TERT gene is inactive in
                        most somatic cells, but it can be expressed exogenously
                        to prevent replicative senescence.
