                  Primary cells, like fibroblasts and blood cells, are the
                  foundation material of cellular studies. But often commercial
                  products lack information about derivation, sourcing, and
                  characterisation. This can impact not only research output but
                  also downstream applications. Cell authentication is becoming
                  an important requirement for publishing in high impact
                  journals and acquiring regulatory approval. Our cells are
                  unique as they have the genotype information available for
                  major drug-metabolizing enzymes such as Cytochrome P450.

                      Yes, there are several methods for immortalizing mammalian
                      cells in culture conditions. Overriding the cell cycle
                      with a viral gene is one of the most common methods. Virus
                      genes can affect cell proliferation by deregulating
                      biological brakes controlling proliferative control. The
                      expression of Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase protein
                      (TERT) is another method, particularly for human cells,
                      which are highly affected by shortened telomeres. The TERT
                      gene is inactive in most somatic cells, but it can be
                      expressed exogenously to prevent replicative senescence.
